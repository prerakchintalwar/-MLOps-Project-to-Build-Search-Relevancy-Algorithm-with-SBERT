This includes US$1b in a next- generation assurance technology platform – which is part of a sustained focus on providing high-quality audits and responding rapidly to changing expectations from regulators, governments, standard setters, audit committees and boards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing investment in sustainability and technology training\n",
      "\n",
      "In FY22 there were EY investments of US$300m in training which delivered more than 59 hours of training per employee on average. The EY organization now offers more than 250 learning accreditations – known as EY Badges – across a range of disciplines: including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, impact entrepreneurship, supply chain planning, DE&I and sustainable business practices, in addition to technical training in accounting and tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year EY announced two new master’s degrees in collaboration with Hult International Business School. The new qualifications - in Business Analytics and Sustainability - are open and free to all EY people alongside the EY Tech MBA by Hult. 95 people graduated with an EY Tech MBA and 10 people graduated in the first cohort of the Master’s in Business Analytics this year. Cumulatively, 130 people have graduated from the Tech MBA and master’s programs. EY also opened the EY Tech University in Palo Alto, California, delivering programs in disruptive technology for senior executives and clients.\n",

      "Driving the sustainability agenda\n",
      "\n",
      "EY became carbon negative globally in FY21, a major and significant step toward achieving the organization’s ambition of becoming net zero in 2025. EY continues to be carbon negative and remains on track toward achieving this net-zero ambition, with a 56% reduction in emissions recorded in FY22, compared with the baseline set in FY19.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to progress to become more sustainable, the EY organization is focused on the development of alliances, and the creation of innovative ecosystems to address the world’s largest climate-related challenges. EY people have delivered EY Sustainability solutions to more than 3,000 clients, including technology-based solutions through alliances with Enablon, IBM, Microsoft and SAP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, EY has developed a specific methodology to provide assurance on nonfinancial reporting based on the globally accepted International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000) released by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). The organization has also issued new guidance on the audit of financial reporting to help EY audit teams consider the effects of climate-related risks on financial statements.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A focus on EY people\n",
      "\n",
      "This year EY evolved its approach to diversity and inclusiveness by explicitly incorporating equity. Now referred to as Diversity, Equity and Inclusiveness (DE&I), this furthers the organization’s commitment to creating an inclusive environment and removing barriers to equal outcomes so everyone can thrive. EY continues to be a purpose-led organization with a culture that is strongly committed to DE&I.\n",

      "In FY22 35% of partner, principal, executive director, and director (PPEDD) promotions were women. Overall, there were more than 2,400 promotions to PPEDD this year - the largest ever cohort for the EY organization.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To better understand and support the needs of EY people and ensure hidden inequities are uncovered and addressed, EY expanded global self-identification (Self-ID) capabilities. This increased range of choices for EY people to complete under ‘personal information’ provides EY with a deeper understanding of the EY population, strengthening EY’s commitment to driving greater equity in areas relating to career development by monitoring and analyzing demographic trends and gaps.\n",

      "The EY global organization set the ambitious goal of positively impacting one billion lives by 2030 through the EY Ripples corporate responsibility program. Since EY Ripples was established in November 2018, more than 81m lives have been positively impacted, including 27m lives in FY22. In FY22 there were total investments made up of US$159m in projects dedicated to strengthening local communities, with EY people contributing more than 1.1m hours of time to a variety of initiatives and value-in-kind projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "EY and Microsoft formed a social impact alliance in FY22 to increase social equity in the digital economy and support millions of people to enter or re-enter the workforce or build new businesses by 2025. An ongoing cross-sector collaboration with Unilever and the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) through TRANSFORM has also positively impacted the lives of 6m people from low-income households across 13 countries since 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The EY organization is further collaborating to make progress on environmental challenges. EY joined over 90 organizations in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and became a signatory to Carbon Call to encourage more organizations to report their emissions regularly, transparently and comprehensively.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "EY leaders have now recommended that the organization evolves into two distinct, multidisciplinary organizations. One would be a global network of multidisciplinary member firms committed to assurance, tax and advisory services with all the capabilities required to deliver high-quality audits, serve the public interest and focus on the CFO agenda and sustainability; and the other would be a new global corporate entity comprising Consulting, Strategy and Transactions (SaT), the majority of Tax, and managed services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In taking this bold step, EY can better serve EY people, clients and broader stakeholders in a once in a generation opportunity to redefine the future of professional services. This move will create better and more dynamic career opportunities; people can learn more, take on new roles and explore different mobility options.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It would mean increased access to capital to reinvest in people and client services and solutions, with a laser focus on the issues that matter most to clients and stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It would also mean more choice for clients for both audit and transformation services, and an even stronger focus on ESG priorities, as well as more opportunities to develop new corporate responsibility programs – such as co-investments in “green” projects – so that we can make an even bigger impact in the communities in which we operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Both organizations will be values-focused and purpose-driven, and both will preserve the strong EY culture and commitment to DE&I.\n",
